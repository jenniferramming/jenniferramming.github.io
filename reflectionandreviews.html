<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>One page portfolio sites like the ones on Cargo and Pinterest influenced my design the most. I am most proud of the color scheme that sets it apart. I struggled with layout and floats, particularly when I switched to using ems and percentages instead of using fixed widths. I learned the importance of designing mobile first when making my site responsive.</p> 

<h1>Reviews</h1>
<p><a href=“https://medium.com/“>Medium</a> has a clean, responsive design and an intuitive layout. It took me very little time to glean the intent of the site, and to notice the call to action to add to the site myself. 
</p>
<p><a href=“http://mimarch.net/“>Mimarch</a> is very busy, and has no clear hierarchy, especially since there are 2 menus, yet none of the links took me away from the home page. The whizzing portfolio in the center frustrated me more than impressed me, and is cluttered with unnecessary details. I would not hire this company.</p>
